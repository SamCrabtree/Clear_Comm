        <i>That may be the way people do it on the Soviet Space Station, but alas... seems you messed up something. This error often means the URL/Page you are looking for doesn't exist. This could be simply because you mis-entered the URL, or the page has been removed/renamed by the IT crew. Either that, or it's those darn computer viruses trying to foil MegaMan and his buddies again... Either way, check your URL and try again! </i>
